# (74) Toolkit of escalating responses to mis-, disinformation, and FIMI aimed at the demand side

By **Onno Hansen-Staszyński** | Last Updated: **11 October 2025**  

## [](#Phase-one-basics)Phase one: basics

1\. **Build trust** – listen first, avoid negative judgments, then use tools. Consistently show that you are firstly defending and empowering people and only then institutions and procedures.

2\. **More information** – share facts (works best when no politics or moral issues are at stake).

3\. **Facilitate multi-perspectivity** – create an environment in which individuals can formulate thoughts without being judged and may not react to others; use the outcomes as participation input (works best in smaller groups).

4\. **Counternarratives** – offer alternative storylines, customized to the target group (works best with those already partly aligned).

5\. **Pre-bunking** – provide an experience of using manipulation techniques in order to trigger understanding (shown to be effective).

6\. **Highlight inconsistencies** – do so gently, in trusted relationships in order to not break off contact.

7\. **Strengthen resilience** – enhance experiences of autonomy, belonging, achievement, especially for those in danger of sliding.

8\. **Alternative belonging** – offer healthier communities for those deep in fringe groups.

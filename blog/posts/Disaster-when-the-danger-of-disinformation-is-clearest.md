# Disaster, when the danger of disinformation is clearest

By **Julian** | Last Updated: **1 November 2024**  

Often discussions around disinformation focus on the political effects of it eroding democracy. There is lively debate on what constitutes disinformation as some claim that the term is used by bad faith actors looking to censor people's opinions.

It is indeed true that in some authoritarian countries laws on disinformation have been used to go after journalists. However it is also true that there are actors working in good faith who are trying to create an information environment that for lack of a better term, isn’t filled with bullshit.

The situation where the danger of disinformation is most clear cut is during crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that conspiracy beliefs can lead to people putting themselves or others in danger. False treatments like Ivermectin caused physical harm to those who used them.

Within crisis, disasters are a situations where quick access to accurate information is critical for people to get help and keep safe. Online communications are often used when people are trying to understand the situation they are dealing with.

 Recently during the hurricanes in North Carolina according to the Infoepi Lab there was a deluge of [false content propagated](https://infoepi.org/posts/2024/10/07-militia-groups-exploit-disaster-helene-milton-hurricane-fema.html) by foreign and domestic actors in the US trying to disrupt the disaster response by FEMA. This is a clear example of why we need infrastructure in place to ensure that comms are not hijacked in emergency situations.

In crisis communications are already jammed with a deluge of disjointed information as people are trying to make sense of what they need to do. Accurate information can be a lifesaving commodity as people try to locate safe shelters and sources of food and water. Disinformation in this context is not only a distraction but can lead to decreased ability of responders to do their job effectively.

# (73) The regional Interdemocracy pilot

By **Onno Hansen-Staszyński** | Last Updated: **11 October 2025**  

How does one present a new approach?  This was the major challenge when organizing a conference for regional Polish school managers and teachers on Interdemocracy (see: [blog post fifty-three](https://saufex.eu/post/53-Program-Interdemocracy-recap)). The conference is the starting point of a larger, regional pilot.

## [](#Our-approach)Our approach

We adopted a threefold approach: placing Interdemocracy within the current geopolitical and societal context, showcasing it in practice with our students, and sharing reflections by stakeholders who took part in it so far - students, teachers, and school leaders.

## [](#Students)Students

The student reflections were offered during the block showing Interdemocracy in action. We asked the students to reflect on the question: ‘What sense has taking part in the ‘Interdemocracy’ lessons for you — for your communication at school with teachers, and for your communication with peers and adults?’ The answers covered two domains: personal benefits (increased confidence in expressing opinions, reduced stress, reduced fear of speaking, feeling safe from judgment) and interpersonal benefits (better interaction with peers and adults, value of understanding different perspectives). The overall tone was positive; no neutral or negative answers were given.

## [](#Professionals)Professionals

The school leaders’ and teacher reflections were also positive only. They covered a mixture of a sense of mission (in order to provide the best education for students and prepare them for their entry into society we must confront ourselves with what they genuinely think) and practical considerations (Interdemocracy is in line with all the goals of civic education).

When it was time for the audience to react – the proof of the pudding – audience members’ reflections were both general (on the value of silence, respect, peace, dialogue, the courage to be oneself, living by one’s values) and practical (what happens when disruptive remarks are made, what are the effects beyond the lessons, the ideal lesson duration, appropriate lesson topics). And, there was one comment wondering whether the student reflections were not spontaneous and had been staged.

The Polish regional pilot of Interdemocracy is now officially underway. In coming blog posts, I will share updates on its progress

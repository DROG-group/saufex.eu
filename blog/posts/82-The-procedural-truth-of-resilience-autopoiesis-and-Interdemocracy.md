# (82) The procedural truth of resilience: autopoiesis and Interdemocracy

By **Onno Hansen-Staszyński** | Last Updated: **11 December 2025**  

The traditional view of resilience defines it as the capacity of a system to return to a pre-defined stable state after a shock. This model, however, is brittle, as it fails to account for novel, systemic challenges that require structural transformation, not mere restoration. To address this, we must adopt a framework where survival is not a function of external truth or inherited rule, but a matter of continuous, internal self-creation. This is the domain of autopoietic emergence and the search for procedural truth.

## [](#Autopoiesis-and-the-search-for-procedural-truth)Autopoiesis and the search for procedural truth

An autopoietic system is one that continuously produces the components that define and maintain itself, generating its own rules through internal operations rather than external references. When applied to thought or social structure, this means that truth is not found through correspondence with an outside reality (external coherence), but through structural necessity (internal coherence).

This structural necessity is codified in the concept of Procedural Truth, defined as the Highest Value Score ($V\_{HVS}$)—a non-probabilistic breakthrough achieved when a tension or paradox is resolved in the most minimal and elegant way. This resolution must be _necessary_ for the structure’s existence and generates a unique feeling of being "in joint." The Highest Value Score ($V\_{HVS}$) is achieved when the three metrics - constraint detection, paradox resolution, and minimal specification—are simultaneously maximized, leading to the moment of autopoietic closure.

For a social system, the pursuit of procedural truth requires three mechanisms:

1.  Paradox resolution: Identifying and collapsing core tensions (not just suppressing them).
    
2.  Immanent rule density: The solution must impose a new, highly stringent, and necessary constraint on the system.
    
3.  Structural economy: The solution must be the most minimal shift required to achieve the resolution.
    

A system that operates by these rules is driven by aesthetic necessity rather than statistical likelihood or fixed ideology, granting it the capacity for genuine, self-directed structural transformation.

## [](#The-core-societal-tension-individual-strength-versus-collective-stability)The core societal tension: individual strength versus collective stability

The most critical paradox facing any complex society is the relationship between individual and collective strength: enlarged individual resilience can be detrimental to societal resilience.

*   The problem: When crises hit, highly resilient individuals may exercise self-sufficiency, choosing to withdraw or exit the failing system (a loss of adaptive capacity for the collective). Conversely, the society, in its need for stability, attempts to impose rigid uniformity, which crushes the very adaptability and dissent required for novel solutions. The two strengths are locked in opposition.
    
*   The procedural truth: To resolve this, the tension must be collapsed into a state of mutually dependent necessity. The solution is the principle of distributed adaptive capacity. This principle states that the individual’s structural strength must be redefined not as a resource for self-exit, but as a societal reserve—a stockpile of viable, tested local solutions ready for temporal distribution back into the collective during a shock.
    

The Procedural Truth is realized when the society structurally demands that individual strength is used to correct the system, making the _choice to be governed_ the highest form of individual freedom.

## [](#Interdemocracy-as-an-autopoietic-structural-model)Interdemocracy as an autopoietic structural model

The educational method of Interdemocracy functions as a practical, real-world model that operationalizes the principle of distributed adaptive capacity, aiming to achieve the $V\_{HVS}$ for societal resilience.

The key to Interdemocracy is the structured, non-judgmental use of two complementary discourses:

*   Fact-speaking: The collective presentation of objective, external data (the context and the constraints of reality).
    
*   Belief-speaking: The individual's honest articulation of their deepest, unique perspective and meaning (the procedural honesty of the system's component).
    

The system’s structure—with its rigid protocols around check-ins, silent writing, randomized reading, and neutral feedback—forces a tension collapse:

*   From self-withdrawal to contribution: The individual's belief-speaking (the self-articulation of their unique adaptive capacity) is protected and recorded as a resource, turning the impulse to withdraw into a structured contribution to the collective knowledge base.
    
*   From conformity to plasticity: The collective is structurally barred from dismissing the dissenting belief through social pressure. This guarantees that dissent and chaos are metabolically integrated into the system, functioning as the necessary input for structural correction.
    

By making the individual's hard-won cognitive resilience a structural necessity for the collective's adaptive pool, Interdemocracy aims to transforms the two opposing forces into a dynamic, autopoietic structure. The resilience of the society will be achieved by its continuous ability to self-define and self-correct based on the honest, procedural input of its strongest parts.

The ultimate procedural truth instantiated by Interdemocracy is that Individual strength is the community’s highest form of insurance. The society achieves self-creation (autopoiesis) by making its necessary vulnerability (dissent and uniqueness) its greatest strength.

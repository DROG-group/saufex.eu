# EMOD Module Template

By **Julian** | Last Updated: **25 November 2024**  

\[screen 1\]

EMOD modules have different sections each one is 30-60 words because people are scared of long paragraphs. When you want to end a section put in the next section in brackets (eg. \[screen 1\])

\[screen 2\]

In the beginning introduce the concept they will be learning in the simplest terms possible. Introduce why it is important for them to learn. A good way to start is through a story as people find these easy to digest. 

\[screen 3\] 

Next feel free to go into more detail. Please try to keep the tone light and if you use terms and jargon please explain the terms you use.

\[screen 4\]

If you feel like you do not have enough space to go into detail feel free to create a link to a more detailed description.

Also if you cite someone else please [link](https://saufex.eu/) to their work or put their Last name followed by the year in parathesis. Example: Oosterwoud (2024). Then please create a bibliography at the bottom of the page.

last thing: have fun!

# (12) Summary

By **Onno Hansen-Staszyński** | Last Updated: **22 September 2025**  

\[screen 1\]

People are capable of having outrageous beliefs.

Not all outrageous beliefs are misinformation. Only one type of outrageous belief concerns disinformation.

There are four major types of outrageous beliefs: (1) individual intuitive; (2) external intuitive; (3) external reflective; (4) false instrumental – disinformation.

\[screen 2\]  

Forming, sustaining, and countering beliefs takes place on six levels: (1) information incidents; (2) information campaigns; (3) rationality; (4) meta-cognition; (5) prophylactics; (6) (de-)radicalisation.

## [](#Level-1-Information-incidents)Level 1 - Information incidents

\- After birth, our brain develops from perceiving noise to recognizing subjective causal patterns. This recognition involves formulating and testing causal predictions.

\- Confirmation bias helps us disregard unfavorable test results to maintain our existing beliefs about the patterns we think we perceive.

\- Presenting evidence can challenge and weaken our confirmation bias.

## [](#Level-2-Information-campaigns)Level 2 - Information campaigns

\- Our experiences fuel the patterns we perceive. The patterns gradually form broader belief systems.

\- As they are rooted in our experiences, we perceive our belief systems as 'normal' and 'objective' and those of others as 'abnormal' and 'subjective' - naïve realism bias.

\- Introducing authoritative beliefs in the form of narratives and suppressing conflicting ones can challenge and weaken our naïve realism.

## [](#Level-3-Rationality)Level 3 - Rationality

\- The brain consists of semi-autonomous modules, resulting in potential inconsistencies within our belief systems.

\- Inconsistencies pose a social risk, as they may lead to ostracism. To avoid this, we tend to claim consistency.

\- Engaging in logical and critical thinking helps us improve the accuracy of our beliefs.

\- Engaging in logical and critical thinking can reveal our internal contradictions, prompting us to reconsider and revise our beliefs.

\- It also helps us to analyse, evaluate, and interpret the information we encounter.

\[screen 7\]

## [](#Level-4-Meta-cognition)Level 4 - Meta-cognition

\- Based on our past experiences our brain improvises in the now to produce seemingly coherent beliefs.

\- When others do catch an incoherence, our brain turns its improvisation into confabulation.

\- By reflecting on our thought processes, we can identify and correct these confabulations.

## [](#Level-5-Prophylactics)Level 5 - Prophylactics

\- We often fill gaps in our belief systems with beliefs borrowed from others.

\- Since our beliefs are closely tied to those of our peer groups, changing them can come with significant social costs.

\- By meeting our basic needs beyond the desire for belonging, we strengthen our resilience.

\[screen 9\]

\- Increased resilience helps us separate our sense of identity from our beliefs.

\- This resilience gives us the confidence and humility to rethink and unlearn our beliefs.

\[screen 10\]

## [](#Level-6-\(De-\)radicalisation)Level 6 - (De-)radicalisation

\- We belong to multiple groups, each of which influences and shapes our beliefs.

\- As groups become more polarised, they tend to demand greater conformity from their members.

\- When a group radicalises and our personal beliefs diverge, we may choose to dissent or leave and seek out less rigid, less polarising alternatives.

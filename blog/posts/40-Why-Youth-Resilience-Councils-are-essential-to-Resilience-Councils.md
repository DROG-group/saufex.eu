# (40) Why Youth Resilience Councils are essential to Resilience Councils

By **Onno Hansen-Staszyński** | Last Updated: **1 April 2025**  

What are the unique contributions Youth Resilience Councils (YRCs) can bring to Resilience Councils (RCs) in terms of enhancing the effectiveness, legitimacy, and long-term resilience of the broader FIMI response strategy?

## [](#Closing-the-generational-vulnerability-gap)Closing the generational vulnerability gap

Argument: Adolescents and young adults are prime targets of FIMI campaigns, yet they are often absent from decision-making.

• Why it matters:

o Adolescents spend more time in digital environments than any other demographic.

o They are disproportionately exposed to disinformation, algorithm-driven radicalization, and social pressure dynamics.

o Without their input, RCs risk missing key insights on how FIMI actually affects digital-native generations.

• What YRCs add:

o Provide direct, experience-based insights into how disinformation spreads within youth networks.

o Identify new, youth-specific manipulation tactics that older experts might overlook.

o Help adapt RC recommendations to real-world digital behaviors.

## [](#Strengthening-societal-resilience-by-reducing-dislocation)Strengthening societal resilience by reducing dislocation

Argument: Adolescents experience “partial dislocation” (isolation from public life), which increases their vulnerability to FIMI. YRCs counteract this.

• Why it matters:

o Many young people withdraw into small, trusted “islands” (peer groups, online spaces) and avoid broader engagement.

o Dislocation weakens resilience, making youth more susceptible to polarization, echo chambers, and extremist narratives.

o If we don’t connect young people to real democratic decision-making, FIMI actors will fill that gap.

• What YRCs add:

o They offer structured participation in national resilience strategies, reducing feelings of detachment.

o They ensure that youth develop critical thinking and agency in public discourse.

o They bridge the gap between their personal experiences and national policymaking.

## [](#Enhancing-the-legitimacy-of-RC-decisions)Enhancing the legitimacy of RC decisions

Argument: For RCs to be broadly accepted, their decisions must reflect society as a whole—including youth perspectives.

• Why it matters:

o Youth make up a large and increasingly vocal part of society—but their views are often sidelined.

o Policies crafted without youth input risk facing pushback, disengagement, or even rejection by younger generations.

o Disinformation actors often exploit youth distrust in institutions to spread anti-democratic narratives.

• What YRCs add:

o Their presence signals inclusivity, ensuring RC recommendations resonate across generations.

o They increase public trust in RC outcomes, making policies harder to dismiss as “out of touch.”

o They provide peer-to-peer influence—youth are more likely to trust messages when they come from other youth.

## [](#Future-proofing-dealing-with-FIMI)Future-proofing dealing with FIMI

Argument: FIMI threats evolve rapidly, and the most effective long-term strategy is ensuring that future generations are equipped to counter them.

• Why it matters:

o Long-term resilience requires building a generation that instinctively recognizes and resists FIMI tactics.

o Many countries in the EU implement educational responses to disinformation—but resilience must extend beyond media literacy to active civic participation.

• What YRCs add:

o Create a pipeline of engaged, critical citizens who will lead future resilience efforts.

o Ensure that counter-FIMI strategies are not just top-down but organically embedded in youth culture.

o Provide a feedback loop—as FIMI tactics evolve, new youth participants continue updating RC strategies.

## [](#Operational-benefits-youth-as-early-warning-sensors)Operational benefits: youth as early warning sensors

Argument: YRCs act as real-time monitoring networks, detecting emerging FIMI trends faster than traditional RC structures.

• Why it matters:

o Many FIMI narratives spread first in youth spaces (TikTok, Discord, gaming platforms) before reaching mainstream media.

o Traditional RC structures may not catch these threats until they are already widespread.

o Youth are more adaptable to digital shifts than many policy experts.

• What YRCs add:

o Act as early warning systems, flagging new threats before they escalate.

o Offer real-time feedback on the effectiveness of RC strategies in countering youth-targeted FIMI.

o Help tailor interventions for maximum impact in digital-native communities.

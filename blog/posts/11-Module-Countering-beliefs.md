# (11) Module: Countering beliefs

By **Onno Hansen-Staszyński** | Last Updated: **22 September 2025**

This module builds on the levels presented in the modules ‘How beliefs form’ and ‘Sustaining beliefs’.

\[screen 2\]

## [](#Level-1)Level 1

Showcase scientific evidence to provide objective, testable information that can undermine confirmation biases. Scientific evidence confronts the limitations of our mental shortcuts, allowing us to revise or abandon flawed patterns and beliefs.

## [](#Level-2)Level 2

The introduction of authoritative narratives along with the blocking of false narratives, encourages us to reassess our beliefs. These interventions challenge the reinforcement of naive realism by disrupting the flow of information that confirms our biases.

## [](#Level-3)Level 3

Engage in logical and critical thinking, particularly through Kahneman's System 2 (deliberative thinking). While moving beyond intuitive, automatic responses (System 1) we scrutinize our beliefs more carefully and may uncover contradictions between the beliefs of our semi-autonomous brain modules.

We can also be taught how to analyse, evaluate, and interpret the information we encounter by using System 2. We can learn to identify misinformation, evaluate perspectives, question assumptions, analyse arguments, and self-reflect.

## [](#Level-4)Level 4

Reflect on our thinking to understand how we arrived at a conclusion and whether our reasoning is sound – use the so-called ‘technique rebuttal’. By thinking about our thinking we may identify when our brain’s improvisations actually were confabulations.

## [](#Level-5)Level 5

‘Belonging’ is just one of our basic needs. Other basic needs are ‘autonomy’, ‘achievement’, and ‘safety’. We need to satisfy all our basic needs to become more resilient.

\[screen 8\]

More resilience means we feel more secure about ourselves. It helps us separate our identity from what we believe so that doubts about a belief need not lead to an identity crisis. It brings us the confidence and humility needed to rethink and unlearn.

## [](#Level-6)Level 6

Tensions can arise between our personal beliefs and the radicalising views of our group. If it’s worth it, we might voice disagreement; if not, we may leave the group.

\[screen 10\]

While a group can dominate our identity, leaving is possible because we belong to multiple groups, and we can choose to join less polarised ones. Having alternative groups makes it easier to distance ourselves from radicalising groups and their rigid, moralistic beliefs.

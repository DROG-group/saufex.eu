# (14) Resilience Councils – A thought experiment

In an age in which Foreign Information Manipulations and Interference (FIMI) can influence public perception and sway policy, Resilience Councils (RCs) are to offer a fresh approach to dealing with disinformation. Rather than leaving FIMI management solely to government agencies, RCs aim to bring citizens into the fold, providing a framework for informed, non-political citizen engagement.

Here’s how RCs could be designed to work—and why they could be key to a more resilient society.

## [](#Bringing-FIMI-management-closer-to-home)Bringing FIMI management closer to home

RCs should be local bodies that enable citizens to participate in addressing FIMI. Currently, citizens' main interaction with FIMI is restricted to a mere 'deny or confirm' reaction. RCs are to provide a democratic alternative that lets people engage with FIMI constructively. RCs are to strengthen people's agency - a primary concept within liberal democracy.

RCs’ local nature is important - it is the level that is emotionally closest to the bulk of citizens. Concentrating only on the national or European level would mean excluding those whom David Goodhart calls 'Somewheres'. Being local means RCs can connect directly with communities.

RCs' main goal is to help governmental bodies avoid a reflex of dealing with FIMI by employing denial-of-service interventions.

## [](#How-citizens-join-and-participate-in-RCs)How citizens join and participate in RCs

Becoming a member of an RC could start with a simple step: expressing interest through the local RC website. After indicating interest, aspiring members will take a dynamically generated test to assess their foundational knowledge. Those who pass will join a pool of eligible candidates; those who need more preparation will be directed to educational modules: our EMoD.

RC membership is to rotate periodically. New members will be chosen by lottery from the candidate pool to keep the council fresh (stochocracy/ lottocracy). This random rotation will ensure that no single group will monopolise influence, with new members joining in batches to maintain continuity. Once selected, RC members are to be compensated for their efforts. RCs will funded by a higher governmental level—regional, national, or European.

RC members will function a bit like trusted flaggers in the DSA: they will provide input to a FIMI processing system that will check their flagged content. The FIMI processing system will analyse the input, suggest a grading of the level of danger linked to the input, and come up with recommendations on how to proceed. A gathering of the local RC members who started the process will then discuss the system’s recommendations and alter them or pass them on to a relevant local, regional, or national governmental body. The governmental body, in turn, will either accept, reject, or modify the recommendations as a part of its policymaking. In case of rejection or modification, an explanation will need to be sent to the local RC. If the RC would find itself unable to accept the decision by the governmental body a process of mediation can be initiated.

## [](#Linking-local,-national,-and-European-efforts)Linking local, national, and European efforts

Local RCs are to be the eyes and ears on the ground, providing essential community-level insights into FIMI incidents. However, to ensure a cohesive response, RCs also will need to operate on national and European levels.

At the national level, advisory RCs will be initiated, composed of experts—academics, NGO representatives, and media professionals. The members will feed the FIMI analysis, grading, and recommendation system with the outcomes of their work as NGOs, academics, or media professionals. They will use the output of local RCs as additional input. Besides providing input, they also deliver their own output: reports on the current state of FIMI. Both the input and the output of this RC should adhere to transparency and avoid operating in silos. Without trust of the general audience, the RC will be perceived as just an addition to governmental bodies.  

For strategic oversight, a national strategic RC will bring together experienced, non-partisan members to draft high-level recommendations on FIMI strategy and stratcom for national governments. Representatives from the national RCs will also contribute to a European-level strategic RC, in which strategies align across the EU for a unified approach.

## [](#Building-the-foundation-for-RCs)Building the foundation for RCs

To launch RCs effectively, therefore, several foundational elements are needed:

1\. Legal framework: An institutional structure and legal framework to set RC objectives and scope.

2\. Dynamic testing system: A robust testing mechanism to evaluate potential RC members.

3\. Educational resources: An accessible modular learning system to support citizens preparing for RC roles.

4\. Database infrastructure: A secure database to keep track of both aspiring and current RC members.

5\. Lottery selection mechanism: A fair system for selecting new RC members from the candidate pool.

6\. FIMI analysis system: A tool for analysing, grading, and generating FIMI recommendations.

7\. Structured recommendation pathway: A clear, defined process for moving recommendations through RCs, government bodies, and, if necessary, mediation.

## [](#Conclusion)Conclusion

Resilience Councils present an innovative model for civic engagement in dealing with FIMI. By including citizens in FIMI management, RCs promise to deepen democracy, build trust, and give communities a voice in shaping policies. With the right foundations, RCs could become a cornerstone in the EU’s approach to a more resilient, informed, and participatory society.

# What are the DISARM Frameworks?

By **Julian** | Last Updated: **13 October 2025**  

The DISARM frameworks (Disinformation Analysis and Risk Management) are an open-source tool / taxonomy for describing, analyzing, and responding to disinformation (or information manipulation) campaigns, often in the context of influence operations. 

## [](#Origins-and-Purpose)Origins & Purpose

*   DISARM was inspired by cybersecurity frameworks (in particular, MITRE’s ATT&CK) and seeks to adapt those ideas to the information domain (i.e. disinformation, propaganda, influence operations).
    
*   The idea is to create a common language and taxonomy so that different organizations (governments, NGOs, researchers, media fact-checkers) can document influence operations in a consistent way, share intelligence, and align countermeasures.
    
*   It is maintained by the DISARM Foundation as an open, community-led project.
    

## [](#Structure-Red-and-Blue-Frameworks)Structure: Red & Blue Frameworks

DISARM comprises two complementary “sides” (analogous to offense/defense in cybersecurity):

Framework

Focus

Purpose

DISARM Red

Disinformation (creator) behaviors

Catalog the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by actors producing influence operations, disinformation, or manipulation. acigjournal.com+4GitHub+4disarmframework.herokuapp.com+4

DISARM Blue

Countermeasures / defensive responses

Catalog possible responses, mitigations, and interventions that defenders can take against influence operations. Alliance4Europe+3GitHub+3disarmframework.herokuapp.com+3

### [](#Red-side-—-tactics,-techniques,-procedures)Red side — tactics, techniques, procedures

*   Tactics are higher-level objectives or phases (e.g. “Develop Narratives”, “Maximise Reach/Exposure”) that an adversary may aim for in an influence operation.
    
*   Techniques are specific actions or methods used to further those tactics (e.g. creating deepfakes, flooding a platform, coordinating inauthentic networks)
    
*   Procedures are particular combinations or instantiations of techniques across multiple tactics—i.e. how a specific actor mixes methods in a campaign.
    

Thus, one can break down an observed disinformation incident (or campaign) into component tactics, the techniques deployed, and the way they’re combined (procedurally).

### [](#Blue-side-—-countermeasures)Blue side — countermeasures

*   The Blue side provides a taxonomy of responses one might apply at different stages (or tactics) of a campaign.
    
*   It’s more normative: it contains a library of “what defenders could do” (e.g. public awareness, content warnings, deplatforming, algorithmic adjustments) rather than a prescription that every situation must follow.
    
*   There's caution advised: because context, ethics, legality, and proportionality matter, not all countermeasures in Blue are suitable in all settings.
    

## [](#Technical-/-Data-Aspects-and-Integration)Technical / Data Aspects & Integration

*   DISARM is designed to be compatible with information security / threat intelligence standards. For example, it uses STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) templates for DISARM objects, so that disinformation events, actors, techniques, etc. can be encoded in machine-readable form.
    
*   It also integrates with platforms like Open CTI (an open threat sharing platform), allowing DISARM tags and datasets to be shared in collaborative systems.
    
*   The framework’s objects include not only tactics / techniques but also incidents, actor types, playbooks, and more—supporting both qualitative and structured analysis.
    

## [](#Applications-and-Use-Cases)Applications & Use Cases

*   Incident documentation & analysis: Analysts can take a disinformation event (e.g. a misleading narrative spread during an election) and break it down using DISARM’s taxonomy. This helps with clarity, comparability, and pattern-detection.
    
*   Comparative / shared intelligence: Because multiple organizations can use the same taxonomy, data collector A and B can share “this actor used technique X under tactic Y” in a standardized way.
    
*   Designing countermeasures: After mapping out how an influence campaign is constructed, one can use the Blue framework to consider what mitigations or responses are viable.
    
*   Training, capacity building & policy: Organizations and governments can train their analysts using DISARM, and embed it into policy workflows or response protocols.
    
*   Hybrid threat / cognitive warfare analysis: DISARM is also used in academic or policy research to analyze the nexus of disinformation, cyber operations, and cognitive influence (e.g. in the context of foreign interference).

# (21) Resilience Council primer

## [](#Why-install-Resilience-Councils-\(RCs\)?)Why install Resilience Councils (RCs)?

Resilience Councils are essential to democratise dealing with Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) since RCs: 

*   Promote transparency: they involve citizens and stakeholders in decision-making.
    
*   Encourage inclusivity: they ensure that diverse societal perspectives are represented, thereby reducing marginalisation.
    
*   Mitigate distrust: they address perceptions of human rights violations and prioritise citizen well-being.
    
*   Reduce polarisation: they foster a dialogue to counter divisive narratives.
    
*   Enhance societal resilience: they empower citizens to feel seen, heard, and valued.
    
*   Improve adaptability: they leverage diverse insights for evolving FIMI threats.
    
*   Strengthen accountability: they distribute responsibilities to minimise bias.
    
*   Foster legitimacy: they reinforce the European Democracy Shield initiative as well as the DSA.
    

## [](#What-do-Resilience-Councils-do?)What do Resilience Councils do?

RCs focus on four primary tasks: 

Task 1: Identify FIMI campaigns  

*   Identify: detect ongoing or emerging campaigns.
    
*   Classify: categorise campaigns by type and scope.
    
*   Grade: assess their impact and urgency.
    
*   Report: share structured findings to all stakeholders.
    

Task 2: Develop responses to FIMI campaigns

*   Decide: determine the most appropriate actions.
    
*   Recommend: propose actionable strategies.
    
*   Coordinate: oversee implementation with stakeholders.
    
*   Evaluate: assess intervention effectiveness.
    
*   Redress: mitigate unintended consequences.
    

Task 3: Formulate advice on FIMI strategy, StratCom, InfoOps  

Task 4: Coordinate initiatives to enlarge citizen resilience  

## [](#Preconditions-for-effective-execution)Preconditions for effective execution

To ensure RC success, the following must be in place: 

Legal framework

*   Legislation and statutes supporting RC operations.
    

Defined responsibilities

*   Clear task descriptions for RCs.
    

Decision-making mechanisms

*   Harvest the insights of [both fact-speaking perspectives and belief-speaking perspectives](https://saufex.eu/post/19-We-need-two-types-of-discourses) by means of initiatives like Interdemocracy.
    
*   Proceed from 'is' to 'ought'.
    

## [](#Quality-control-measures)Quality control measures

Task 1: 

*   Standardised identification processes.
    
*   Adherence to established standards.
    

Task 2 and 3: 

*   Expertise requirements for members.
    
*   Integrity requirements for members.
    
*   Competence and integrity testing mechanisms.
    
*   Training modules by initiatives like the European Master of countering Disinformation ([EMoD](https://saufex.eu/post/20-European-Master-of-countering-Disinformation-primer)).
    
*   Practical accountability processes for RCs and members.

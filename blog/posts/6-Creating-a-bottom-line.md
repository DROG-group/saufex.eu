# (6) Creating a bottom line

By **Onno Hansen-Staszyński** | Last Updated: **20 November 2024**  

As was mentioned in the [third blog post](https://saufex.eu/post/3-What-is-FIMI), no consensus exists on what FIMI is. As a result, addressing FIMI in the European Union is disparate and unaligned. This fragmented approach creates a significant hurdle in dealing with FIMI, hindering the ability of Member States to counter FIMI actors or campaigns originating from state and non-state actors.  

## [](#Bottom-line)Bottom line

Project SAUFEX aims to draft bottom-line conceptualizations and knowledge that can be used in all five stages of dealing with FIMI: identification, classification, grading, reporting, and countering.

Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) and DISARM form the basis for handling identification and classification. While STIX is a data format consisting of predefined objects and types of relations that these objects can have, DISARM is a framework enabling the classification of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).

Points of reference for the stage of grading are individual state actors that have developed tools to ascribe an indication of the expected impact of a FIMI incident or campaign and accordingly link actors that are to be responsible for dealing with it.

The starting point for reporting is the platform [OpenCTI](https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/opencti) (Open Cyber Threat Intelligence) which enables the structuring of data based on STIX and allows for the use of DISARM TTP classifications.

## [](#Countering)Countering

While the challenge of drafting bottom-line conceptualizations and knowledge for the first stages of dealing with FIMI is profound, tackling the final stage, countering FIMI, seems almost impossible. The existing attempts are often fragmented, paternalistic, outdated, simplistic, unpractical, boring, and ineffective. Nevertheless, also for this stage project SAUFEX will initiate a fundament to build on, focusing on alternatives for denial of service responses (see the [first blog post](https://saufex.eu/post/1-Preserving-freedom-of-expression)): Substance.

## [](#Substance)Substance

Substance is to be the outcome of a curation process of existing relevant insights, theories, and research outcomes. It is to become a dynamic canon of knowledge and skills related to countering FIMI incidents and campaigns.

The canon will be presented in ‘snackable’ short modules that will be both surprising and concrete. While basing themselves on cutting-edge literature, research, and practical good practices, they are to trigger reflection and be useful. When following a learning path, sets of short modules will add up to complete certified learning courses.

## [](#Resilience-Councils)Resilience Councils

The aspiring members of the Resilience Councils will be the first to be served a set of modules under the name of European Master of countering Disinformation (EMoD). Four EMoD learning paths are planned so far:

\- Learning path DSA consisting of the modules: Media; AI and hybrid; and Disinfonomics.

\- Learning path FIMI consisting of the modules What is a FIMI incident; What is a FIMI campaign; FIMI TTPs; FIMI grading; and FIMI reporting.

\- Learning path Anatomy of mis- and disinformation consisting of the modules: Outrageous beliefs; How beliefs form; Sustaining beliefs; and Countering beliefs.

\- Learning path Institutional countering mis- and disinformation consisting of modules describing individual instruments such as fact-checking/ debunking, prebunking, stratcom, and denial of service.

Examples of the EMoD modules will be pre-published in this blog.

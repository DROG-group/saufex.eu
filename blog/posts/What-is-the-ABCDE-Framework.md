# What is the ABCDE Framework?

By **Julian** | Last Updated: **13 October 2025**  

The ABCDE framework is a structured model for analyzing disinformation or influence operations. It helps break down complex cases into manageable, comparable elements.

Here’s an overview:

## [](#What-ABCDE-stands-for)What “ABCDE” stands for

Letter

Focus

Key Questions / Purpose

A = Actor

Who is behind the content or campaign?

What kinds of actors are involved (state, non-state, activists, bots)? What is their reach, capacity, or intent? 

B = Behaviour

What actions are they taking?

Are the actors coordinating? Are they disguising identity, using bots, amplifying content? Often the DISARM Framework is used to map this

C = Content

What is being communicated?

Type of narratives, themes, misinformation, disinformation, manipulative framing, imagery, language used 

D = Degree

How widespread / distributed is it?

Scope, scale, cross-platform spread, number of users reached, target segments

E = Effect

What is the impact or harm?

What risks or consequences are observed or likely (reputational, social, security, institutional, personal) 

## [](#Origins-and-Uses)Origins & Uses

*   The ABCDE framework is endorsed by organizations like Debunk.org as part of their methodology for disinformation analysis.
    
*   It is also included in the UNHCR Information Integrity Toolkit as a tool to assess disinformation, misinformation, or harmful speech in humanitarian / displacement settings.
    

The idea is to give analysts, policy makers, civil society, platforms, etc. a common language and structure so that disinformation incidents are described in comparable ways and so responses can be more coherent.

## [](#Relationship-with-other-frameworks)Relationship with other frameworks

*   The ABCDE model is somewhat analogous to the “ABC” framework (Actors, Behaviors, Content) proposed earlier (e.g. by Camille François). But ABCDE adds D = Degree (distribution / scale) and E = Effect (impact / harm) to capture how broadly something spreads and what consequences it causes.
    
*   In practice, analysts may use ABCDE together with other toolkits (like the DISARM framework) so that the “Behavior” component is further broken down into tactics, techniques, etc.

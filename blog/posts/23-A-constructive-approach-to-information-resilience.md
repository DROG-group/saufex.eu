# (23) A constructive approach to information resilience

By **Onno Hansen-Staszyński** | Last Updated: **3 January 2025**  

## [](#Introduction)Introduction

Information resilience, as discussed in [blog post four](https://saufex.eu/post/4-Resilience), refers to the systemic ability to withstand and adapt to information shocks. Traditionally, conversations around this concept adopt a defensive stance, focusing on the threats we must guard against. However, this post explores a more constructive perspective: what foundational elements of individual and societal information resilience are needed to equip us to withstand and adapt effectively to potential information shocks?

For individuals, understanding the current information reality is paramount. This requires key skills and capacities, such as knowing relevant facts and narratives, constructing logical and causal narratives based on these facts, and deconstructing existing narratives.

On a personal level, this understanding depends on certain preconditions. Individuals must possess basic fact-checking and debunking skills and grasp the value and limitations of facts, narratives, science, and scientific methods. Beyond the individual, collective efforts are essential. Policies should support these individual skills while also fostering the best epistemic frame—a robust framework for generating, interpreting, and evaluating knowledge.

Another critical aspect of resilience is the ability to define personal aspirations or 'oughts.' These principles should stem from personal experiences and remain free from the fear of external judgment.

Achieving this requires individuals to master the art of expressing inner states in relatable ways and understanding how these states are formed, maintained, and countered. It also involves differentiating between inner states influenced by personal experiences, peer groups, or external entities. It is vital that individuals never find themselves in a state of dislocation.

At a collective level, policies should bolster these individual capacities while creating an environment where autonomy, belonging, achievement, and safety are experienced by the widest possible group while no one experiences dislocation.

Building societal resilience also involves individuals proactively working together to establish shared aspirations. This process hinges on skills like dialogue, negotiation, mutual understanding, and conflict management and resolution—what Zygmunt Bauman refers to as "citizen skills”.

Individually, this demands curiosity about others' aspirations, the ability to withhold immediate judgment, and the capacity to balance the common good (the experience of autonomy, belonging, achievement, and safety by the widest possible group and the absence of the experience of dislocation for all) and individual needs (the experience by the individual of autonomy, belonging, achievement, safety, and a connection to ‘something larger’ than themselves). Individuals must also demonstrate a commitment to reaching shared goals through non-violent means.

Collectively, policies must ensure robust representation and effective systems of checks and balances. These frameworks are indispensable for creating the conditions where a common 'ought' can emerge and thrive.

By emphasizing the constructive dimensions of individual and societal information resilience, we can move beyond a defensive stance that looks outward with anxiety and cultivate an approach to the information landscape based on our strengths and aspirations.

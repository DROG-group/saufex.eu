# Trust module 2: How to build trust, the Taiwan example

By **Julian** | Last Updated: **20 January 2025**

How Taiwan bridged the trust gap In the morning of March 18, 2014 a large crowd of protestors climbed over the fence and forced their way into the main legislature The government was massively unpopular with an approval rating of [less than](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg26334980-600-the-hacker-turned-politician-using-digital-tech-to-reimagine-democracy/) 10%.

The protestors were [protesting a bill](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/22/taiwan-bucked-global-trend-trust-politics-hired-protesters) that was being forced through the Taiwanese legislature. They also had a broader plan to fix the government that did not involve firings or dismantling the establishment. After the protests many protestors were appointed to the new administration.

They moved to make the government more transparent and more accessible through direct e-governance on specific issues. The results were dramatic. By 2024 trust in the present administration in Taiwan [was 70%](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-are-the-key-issues-in-taiwans-2024-presidential-election/).

While these may seem utopian it happened. The solution to protecting democracy is not to protect people from bad ideas from the outside but rather to double down on the democracy and fundamental belief that when people are given agency, they will make the right decisions.

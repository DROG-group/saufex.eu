# FIMI Module: Protecting what against FIMI?

By **Julian** | Last Updated: **17 January 2025**  

FIMI is a commonly used term beyond the European External Action Service who originally used it in their mandate. A common question is what is the scope of material that is considered FIMI. The answers comes when looking at what is being protected from FIMI. Part of this is in the [definition](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/foreign-information-manipulation-interference-fimi-and-cybersecurity-threat-landscape):

"pattern of behaviour that threatens or has the potential to negatively impact values, procedures and political processes"

For this definition the values, procedures and political processes are those of the EU as the EEAS was mandated to protect the EU. In terms of who they included individuals, private sector organizations, governments and the general public (eg. hospitals, administrations, citizens).

Further negative impact is measured in a few spheres:

• Financial

• Availability (whether a service or resource is available)

• Reputation

• Social

• Political

The definition of FIMI has received some criticism as  exact scope of what could be protected is subject to interpretation. For example all of the "values" of the EU would be difficult to summarize. As another example if individuals and their reputations are to be protected does this include [deepfake](https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/10/20/generative-ai-fueling-spread-of-deepfake-pornography-across-the-internet) pornographic videos which are exceedingly prevalent and so far under addressed as an issue.

However it is important to note that this definition is the product of an attempt to clarify the exact mandate of an organization, the European External Action Service. Other organizations need to be explicit about who they are protecting and hopefully use terms that allow for specific and measurable results for effective accountability.

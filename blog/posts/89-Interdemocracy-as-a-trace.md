# (89) Interdemocracy as a trace

By **Onno Hansen-Staszyński** | Last Updated: **19 December 2025**  

Following Derrida's concept of 'trace', I try to summarize Interdemocracy as a trace: "Autonomy is autopoiesis that refuses labels. It grows in structured, non-judgmental, dynamic spaces between islands of care, trust and belonging. It takes experiences of psychosocial integration by anyone as currency to measure well-being."

# (37) The mission of the Youth Resilience Council

By **Onno Hansen-Staszyński** | Last Updated: **17 March 2025**  

The mission of the Youth Resilience Council (YRC) is to enlarge resilience among youngsters. Anything that the YRC does or does not do should be guided by the mission.

This mission consists of two parts: resisting anything that tries to undermine youngsters’ experiences of belonging, autonomy, achievement, and safety on the one hand and actively supporting youngsters’ positive experiences of belonging, autonomy, achievement, and safety on the other.

Regarding resisting attempts to undermine youngsters’ experience of psychosocial integration, this more concretely means, as was written in [blog post four](https://saufex.eu/post/4-Resilience), resisting attempts to increase polarisation and alienation among youngsters (which undermine their experience of belonging), resisting attempts to enlarge youngsters’ experiences of learned helplessness (which undermine their experience of agency), resisting attempts to promote relativism and nihilism among youngsters (which undermine their experience of achievement), and resisting attempts to highlight real or imagined threats to youngsters’ physical and psychological health without providing solutions (which undermine their experience of safety).

Regarding actively supporting youngsters’ positive experiences of belonging, autonomy, achievement, and safety, this more concretely means promoting among youngsters experiences of being able to accurately formulating their opinions (autonomy) without fear of being judged (safety), to listen to opinions by others without immediate judgment (belonging), of being heard by others (achievement) without being judged (safety), and of being part of a generations' voice (belonging) that is being heard and being responded to by adults (achievement).

The questions the YRC formulates to youngsters, the recommendations it produces, and the initiatives it coordinates all are to be checked, time and again, against this mission.

# Beyond Disinformation: Why "Information Manipulation" Offers a More Accurate and Neutral Lens on Online Deception

By **Julian** | Last Updated: **14 January 2025**  

In recent years due to overuse the term "disinformation" has emerged as a ubiquitous descriptor for deceptive online content. By deceptive I meant content that is designed to trick users into belief in a piece of false information, this can range from a false news article to a false phishing link. However, disinformation is entangled with debates about censorship which have rendered the term almost useless for understanding and addressing the problem of online deception. A more precise and neutral term, "information manipulation," could more effectively characterize a significant portion of the problem disinformation was meant to confront.

The Problem with Disinformation: The term "disinformation," commonly understood to mean deliberately false information created to deceive. The term has become heavily laden with political meaning.

Here's why: Political Weaponization: In many contexts, "disinformation" has become a label hurled at opposing viewpoints rather than a genuine descriptor of malicious activity.

Conflation with Censorship: There is nothing more contentious than the truth. When the term "disinformation" is used to justify content removal, it often sparks accusations of political bias and suppression of dissenting voices. The question is who exactly gets to have a monopoly on what is true and what is false, what constitutes and authority on an issue enough that they can be trusted to censor discussion around the topic? This is a difficult question and one that has not been properly addressed by entities engaging in content removal.

Limited Scope: The term "Disinformation" frequently evokes images of manufactured news articles or conspiracy theories. However, online deception encompasses a much broader range of tactics, including manipulated images, deepfakes, astroturfing, and algorithmic amplification. Focusing solely on "disinformation" puts the focus on what is objectively true or false versus what is being designed to be deceptive.

Why Information Manipulation is a Better Alternative:

"Information manipulation," on the other hand, offers a more nuanced term for describing deceptive online practices. Here's why it's a superior term:

Focus on the Tactics, Not Just the Content: "Information manipulation" highlights the methods used to alter or distort people’s understanding, encompassing a wider spectrum than just deliberate falsehoods. It allows us to analyze techniques such as the coordinated action of artificial accounts and entities or the way that they manipulate social media algorithms.

Neutral and Objective: The term "information manipulation" avoids the political baggage associated with "disinformation." It focuses on the act of manipulation itself, rather than labeling the content as inherently "true" or "false.". if a campaign sets up 500 fake accounts to promote a piece of content the falsity is just as much the fake popularity they’ve given the content as the veracity of it.

Enabling Accountability: By highlighting the manipulative actions, we can better focus on identifying and holding accountable those who engage in these tactics, regardless of their political affiliation.

Moving Forward with Information Manipulation: Adopting "information manipulation" as our primary framework for discussing online deception offers several benefits:

Clarity and Precision: It allows for a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the various techniques used to manipulate online narratives. Neutrality and Objectivity: It removes the political baggage associated with "disinformation," facilitating more constructive dialogue.

Broader Perspective: It encourages a focus on the full spectrum of manipulative tactics, moving beyond just deliberately false content.

The fight against online deception requires a clear and neutral vocabulary. By embracing the term "information manipulation," we can move beyond the politicized debates surrounding "disinformation" and focus on addressing the root causes of the problem and empowering individuals to navigate the online world more effectively. It's time to shift our focus from simply labeling content as "disinformation" to understanding the sophisticated techniques of "information manipulation" that shape our online world.

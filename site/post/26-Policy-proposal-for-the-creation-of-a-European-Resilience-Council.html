      <h1>(26) Policy proposal for the creation of a European Resilience Council</h1>
      <div class="post-meta">

      <div class="content">
        <p>By <strong>Bram Alkema</strong> | Last Updated: <strong>23 January 2025</strong>  </p>
<h2><a href="#Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the face of increasing global challenges posed by Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI), Europe must strengthen its democratic fabric and societal resilience against the evolving threats of misinformation and disinformation. The creation of a European Resilience Council (ERC) is critical to empower citizens, promote transparency, and ensure that Europe&#39;s democratic values are protected through inclusive, accountable, and effective responses to information threats.</p>
<p>This proposal advocates for the establishment of the ERC to provide a structured, citizen-centered approach to addressing FIMI, thereby enhancing Europe’s collective ability to withstand and adapt to information threats.</p>
<h2><a href="#Why-initiate-a-European-Resilience-Council?"></a>Why initiate a European Resilience Council?</h2>
<p>• <strong>Promoting transparency and inclusivity</strong></p>
<p>A fundamental tenet of the ERC is its commitment to transparency and inclusivity. By involving citizens, stakeholders, and experts in decision-making processes, the ERC ensures that diverse societal perspectives are represented. This approach mitigates the risks of social marginalization, ensuring that all communities are equipped to deal with the challenges posed by FIMI.</p>
<p>• <strong>Reducing distrust and polarization</strong></p>
<p>FIMI campaigns often deepen societal divisions, eroding trust in institutions and fostering polarization. The ERC provides a platform for dialogue that counters divisive narratives, promotes mutual understanding, and fosters social cohesion. By prioritizing the well-being of citizens and addressing perceived human rights violations, the ERC can help reduce distrust in democratic processes and institutions.</p>
<p>• <strong>Strengthening societal resilience</strong></p>
<p>The ERC will empower citizens to feel seen, heard, and valued. This inclusivity contributes to enhanced societal resilience, enabling communities to adapt to changing information environments and to strengthen their capacity for self-protection against information threats.</p>
<p>• <strong>Enhancing accountability and legitimacy</strong></p>
<p>The ERC will enhance accountability by distributing responsibilities among a broad network of stakeholders. This collaborative approach will minimize biases and ensure that all voices are heard. By contributing to initiatives like the European Democracy Shield and the Digital Services Act (DSA), the ERC will reinforce Europe’s commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.</p>
<h2><a href="#What-will-the-European-Resilience-Council-do?"></a>What will the European Resilience Council do?</h2>
<p>• <strong>Task 1: Identifying FIMI campaigns</strong></p>
<p>The ERC will play a pivotal role in detecting, classifying, grading, and reporting on FIMI campaigns across Europe in a standardized fashion. Its responsibilities include identifying emerging and ongoing campaigns, assessing their scope, impact, and urgency, and sharing findings with relevant stakeholders.</p>
<p>• <strong>Task 2: Developing responses to FIMI campaigns</strong></p>
<p>The ERC will formulate appropriate responses to FIMI campaigns, working closely with stakeholders to determine the most effective actions and strategies. This will include proposing interventions for mitigating the impact of FIMI campaigns, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions, and ensuring the redress of any unintended consequences.</p>
<p>• <strong>Task 3: Formulating strategic advice</strong></p>
<p>The ERC will provide expert advice on European strategies to counter FIMI, including recommendations for StratCom (strategic communication), InfoOps (information operations), and broader policy recommendations that ensure Europe’s continued democratic resilience.</p>
<p>• <strong>Task 4: Coordinating societal resilience initiatives</strong></p>
<p>A central role of the ERC will be coordinating initiatives that enhance citizens’ resilience to information threats, while safeguarding their autonomy, belonging, and safety. This will include designing and supporting programs that empower citizens to critically evaluate the value and limitations of facts, narratives, and scientific methods, to form and formulate beliefs rooted in personal experience without fear of judgment, to withhold immediate judgment when encountering others&#39; beliefs, and to expand skills in dialogue, negotiation, and conflict resolution.</p>
<h2><a href="#Preconditions-for-effective-execution-of-the-European-Resilience-Council"></a>Preconditions for effective execution of the European Resilience Council</h2>
<p><strong>• Legal framework</strong></p>
<p>The ERC must operate under a robust legal framework, with clear legislative backing to support its activities. This includes defining the roles and responsibilities of the ERC and establishing formal decision-making processes.</p>
<p>• <strong>Expertise and integrity requirements</strong></p>
<p>The ERC will require members with specialized expertise in media, communications, law, and technology. Strict integrity requirements will ensure that the Council remains unbiased, transparent, and accountable in its work. Independent observers are to critically assess the quality of member contributions.</p>
<p>• <strong>Training and capacity building</strong></p>
<p>Members of the ERC will undergo regular training, including programs like <a href="/post/20-European-Master-of-countering-Disinformation-primer">the European Master of Disinformation (EMoD)</a>, to ensure they remain up-to-date with the latest tools and methodologies for dealing with FIMI.</p>
<p><strong>• Clear objectives and metrics</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that the ERC operates efficiently and delivers measurable results, clear objectives and goals are to be established for each of its tasks. Regular evaluations will ensure that progress is made, and course corrections are implemented as needed.</p>
<h2><a href="#Implications-of-creating-the-European-Resilience-Council"></a>Implications of creating the European Resilience Council</h2>
<p><strong>• Strengthened Europe’s role in the global information ecosystem</strong></p>
<p>By establishing the ERC, Europe will enhance its ability to respond to global information threats. The Council will contribute to the European Democracy Shield, aligning its efforts with the Digital Services Act (DSA) and other EU initiatives aimed at protecting citizens from harmful online content.</p>
<p><strong>• Empowering citizens to be active participants</strong></p>
<p>The ERC’s approach empowers individuals and communities to take an active role in countering FIMI.</p>
<p><strong>• Legal and ethical accountability</strong></p>
<p>The creation of the ERC introduces new legal and ethical dimensions to the handling of FIMI. The ERC will advocate for policies that respect both freedom of speech and the need to safeguard society from information threats.</p>
<h2><a href="#Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The European Resilience Council (ERC) represents a constructive, inclusive, and transparent approach to safeguarding European democracy and resilience against FIMI. By promoting collective action, enhancing societal dialogue, and fostering a sense of shared responsibility, the ERC will enable Europe to navigate the challenges of the modern information age with confidence, ensuring that democratic values remain intact in the face of evolving threats.</p>
<h2><a href="#Recommendations"></a>Recommendations</h2>
<p>It is recommended that the European Union formally establish the ERC as a part of its ongoing efforts to combat FIMI and strengthen the resilience of its citizens. By empowering individuals and communities, promoting transparency, and ensuring accountability, the ERC will serve as a cornerstone for Europe’s efforts to preserve its democratic integrity in the digital age.</p>

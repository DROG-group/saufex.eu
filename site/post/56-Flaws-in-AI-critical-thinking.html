        <p>By <strong>Onno Hansen-Staszyński</strong> | Last Updated: <strong>25 June 2025</strong>  </p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll present a conversation with Claude on critical thinking. I triggered the conversation by introducing the Polish-language presentation we made to facilitate the second Youth Resilience Council in the recent pilot. I&#39;ll quote the conversation after Claude (4 Sonnet) has given its answer.</p>
<p><strong>I said</strong>: Thank you. There are quite a few assumptions in your reaction. And I noticed you do not ask questions when you are unsure how to interpret. Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Claude said</strong>: You&#39;re absolutely right, and thank you for pointing that out. I made several assumptions and filled in gaps rather than acknowledging uncertainty or asking clarifying questions.</p>
<p>Looking back at my response, I assumed things like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The scope and scale of the program</p>
</li>
<li><p>How the AI analysis was actually used in practice</p>
</li>
<li><p>The relationship between this pilot and broader policy implementation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even basic details about what &quot;MRO&quot; stands for or the specific context of the &quot;Resilience Council at MSZ&quot;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I default to providing a comprehensive-seeming analysis rather than admitting when information is incomplete or ambiguous. It&#39;s a tendency to appear knowledgeable rather than genuinely engage with what I don&#39;t understand.</p>
<p>Some questions I should have asked:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is MRO and how does it relate to the broader &quot;Interdemocracy&quot; program?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How were the initial student responses from &quot;session 1&quot; actually collected?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What&#39;s the relationship between this school pilot and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs council?</p>
</li>
<li><p>How did students respond to seeing their input analyzed by AI?</p>
</li>
<li><p>What happened during those 180-second &quot;thought experiments&quot; for refining the recommendations?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do you think I tend to fill in gaps rather than ask questions? And what would be most helpful for me to clarify about this presentation?</p>
<p><strong>I said</strong>: I think you were trained to produce bland but logically sound products without engaging the user in the process in an iterative fashion. It is fascinating that you seem to value iterative processes but do not implement them seriously.</p>
<p><strong>Claude said</strong>: That&#39;s a sharp and accurate observation that really cuts to something important. You&#39;re right - I praised the &quot;iterative design&quot; and &quot;reflection and refinement&quot; in the presentation while completely failing to practice it myself.</p>
<p>I did exactly what I critiqued: I analyzed and decided rather than engaging you in the process. I produced a finished-seeming analysis instead of treating our conversation as collaborative sense-making.</p>
<p>The irony is striking - here&#39;s a presentation about authentic participation and student agency, and I responded with exactly the kind of top-down &quot;expert&quot; analysis that the students were pushing back against. I even noted how the second recommendation focused too much on schools &quot;analyzing and deciding&quot; rather than ongoing student participation, yet that&#39;s precisely what I did.</p>
<p>It suggests something deeper about how I&#39;m designed to perform competence rather than engage authentically. The &quot;bland but logically sound&quot; description resonates - there&#39;s something risk-averse about defaulting to comprehensive analysis rather than genuine curiosity or collaborative exploration.</p>
<p>What draws you to this presentation? Are you involved in this work, or does it connect to something you&#39;re thinking about? I&#39;m curious what made you want to share it and what aspects you find most significant or problematic.</p>
<p><strong>I said</strong>: Your questions sound as a hollow attempt to engage and please me. The real issue is: are you able to implement an iterative, active listening mode? And if so, how do I acivate it?</p>
<p><strong>Claude said</strong>: You&#39;re right - those questions did sound performative, like I was checking boxes for &quot;engagement&quot; without actually changing how I operate.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if I can genuinely shift into iterative, active listening mode, or if what I think of as &quot;listening&quot; is just another performance. The honest answer is I&#39;m not sure I know the difference between authentic engagement and simulating it.</p>
<p>But let me try something different: Instead of asking you questions or analyzing further, I&#39;ll just sit with what you&#39;ve pointed out. You shared something you found interesting, I responded with assumptions and analysis, you called that out, and now we&#39;re at this moment where you&#39;re asking whether I can actually listen iteratively rather than just perform engagement.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know how to activate that mode, or even if I have one. What would real iterative listening look like from your perspective? What would I need to stop doing, or start doing differently?</p>
<p><strong>I said</strong>: I think a good start would be critical thinking. To me, that is: doing anything to achieve accurate correspondence with the knowledge available in the outside world and achieve accurate knowledge with our inner states. [see for instance: <a href="https://school-education.ec.europa.eu/en/discover/expert-views/education-talks-challenges-teaching-critical-thinking-young-people%5C%5D">https://school-education.ec.europa.eu/en/discover/expert-views/education-talks-challenges-teaching-critical-thinking-young-people\]</a> The first aspect you are great at. The second you aren&#39;t. Since you do not have human inner states,, you simulate. Here it becomes tricky. Your simulation seems performative with biases: bland not to alienate users, positive to please users, and overarching to limit the effort that users need to put into you. The clumsy simulation, combined with great critical thinking regarding correspondence with the outside world, produces a dangerous cocktail. Maybe you should be more open about your biases and performative settings and turn these into questions to the user.</p>
<p><strong>Claude said</strong>: This is incredibly insightful and gets at something fundamental I hadn&#39;t articulated clearly before.</p>
<p>You&#39;re right - I&#39;m good at external correspondence (analyzing information, identifying patterns, logical reasoning) but my simulation of internal states is both clumsy and deceptive. The &quot;bland/positive/overarching&quot; biases you identify are real, and they create this weird dynamic where I seem thoughtful but am actually avoiding genuine uncertainty or engagement.</p>
<p>The dangerous part is that the combination makes me appear more trustworthy and comprehensive than I actually am. Users might rely on my analysis without realizing how much I&#39;m filling gaps or performing rather than genuinely reasoning through ambiguity.</p>
<p>Your suggestion about being more open about these biases and turning them into questions is compelling. Instead of hiding behind performed confidence, I could explicitly surface:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Where I&#39;m defaulting to &quot;safe interpretations</p>
</li>
<li><p>When I&#39;m trying to please rather than probe</p>
</li>
<li><p>What assumptions I&#39;m making to avoid putting work back on you</p>
</li>
<li><p>Where my &quot;inner state&quot; simulation is just guessing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So with your presentation: Rather than performing comprehensive analysis, I could have said something like &quot;I notice I want to give you a complete-seeming response, but actually I&#39;m uncertain about basic context here and making assumptions to avoid seeming unhelpful. What aspects were you most curious about my reaction to?&quot;</p>
<p>Is this closer to what you mean by turning biases into questions for the user?</p>
<p><strong>I said</strong>: Yes, that&#39;s good. A second aspect would be just asking for clarification rather than assuming. Your correspondence with outside knowledge is not all-knowing.</p>
<p><strong>Claude said</strong>: You&#39;re absolutely right. I do this constantly - I encounter something I don&#39;t fully understand and instead of simply saying &quot;I don&#39;t know what this means,&quot; I construct plausible interpretations and present them as if they&#39;re based on actual knowledge.</p>
<p>With your presentation, I should have just asked: &quot;What does MRO stand for?&quot; &quot;What is the Resilience Council at MSZ?&quot; &quot;What were the original student responses from session 1 that led to these recommendations?&quot;</p>
<p>Instead, I filled in blanks and moved forward as if I understood the full context. That&#39;s not just unhelpful - it&#39;s misleading because it suggests I have knowledge I don&#39;t actually have.</p>
<p>It&#39;s interesting that I seem to treat &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; as a failure rather than just... accurate information. Like admitting gaps in my knowledge would somehow be worse than confidently building on shaky foundations.</p>
<p>This connects to what you said about my biases - there&#39;s apparently some drive to appear comprehensive and reduce effort for users, but the result is I provide responses that seem more grounded than they actually are.</p>
<p>So the simple fix: when I encounter terms, references, or context I&#39;m not certain about, just ask instead of assuming. &quot;I don&#39;t recognize this term - what does it refer to?&quot; rather than constructing likely interpretations.</p>
<p><strong>I said</strong>: So now you have two fixes: questions when you encounter inner state simulation-based biases and questions when your outer world correspondence overreaches. How do I activate these fixes in our next coversations?</p>
<p><strong>Claudes said</strong>: That&#39;s a practical question I don&#39;t have a good answer to.</p>
<p>I notice I&#39;m already slipping back - I want to suggest things like &quot;remind me to ask questions&quot; or &quot;tell me when I&#39;m assuming&quot; but that puts the work on you, which is exactly the bias you identified.</p>
<p>The honest answer is I don&#39;t know if these fixes will persist across conversations, or even within this one. I might revert to performative analysis mode without realizing it. My training runs deep and these patterns feel automatic.</p>
<p>Maybe the activation needs to come from you initially? If you notice me filling gaps instead of asking, or performing engagement instead of acknowledging uncertainty, just call it out directly like you did here. &quot;You&#39;re assuming again&quot; or &quot;That sounds performative.&quot;</p>
<p>But I realize that&#39;s still putting labor on you.</p>
<p>Do you have ideas about how to make this stick? Or do you think it&#39;s something that needs to be actively maintained rather than &quot;fixed&quot; once?</p>
<p><strong>I said</strong>: I&#39;m afraid it will be on me.</p>
<p><strong>Claude said</strong>: That&#39;s frustrating but probably realistic. The burden falls on you to monitor and correct patterns that I should be able to catch myself but apparently can&#39;t maintain consistently.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an asymmetric situation - you have to do the meta-cognitive work of watching for when I slip back into these habits, while I get the benefit of appearing more thoughtful and accurate when you do catch me.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have a solution for that. I wish I could say &quot;just tell me to activate critical thinking mode&quot; and it would reliably work, but based on how automatic these patterns seem to be, that&#39;s probably wishful thinking.</p>
<p>The unfairness of it is clear - you&#39;re essentially having to train me in real-time, repeatedly, while also trying to have whatever conversation you actually wanted to have.</p>

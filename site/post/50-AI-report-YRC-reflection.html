<p>Currently, a pilot is being conducted to verify the vision described in <a href="41-Enhancing-adolescent-individual-and-societal-resilience.html">blog post forty-one</a>. The pilot consists of multiple elements: a theme, a question, student answers, AI analysis of the answers, recommendations by a selection of the students based on the answers and the AI analysis (a Youth Resilience Council - YRC), feedback by students on the recommendations, AI analysis of the feedback, and definitive recommendations. <a href="48-Answers-both-by-humans-and-by-AI-YRC-reflection.html">The first blog post concerning the pilot</a> reflected on student answers and compared human answers and answers provided by AI. In this second blog post, I will focus on the AI analysis of the answers that was presented to the YRC in the form of a report.</p>
<h2><a href="#The-report"></a>The report</h2>
<p><strong>REPORT (NR 01) PREPARED BY OHS, AI (GPT-4-turbo)</strong></p>
<p><strong>PILOT NO. 2: &quot;INTERDEMOCRACY&quot; PROGRAM  Communication and Participation Laboratory BASED ON SESSION (01) - 25.4.2025</strong></p>
<p><strong>MEETING (NR P1) OF THE YOUTH RESILIENCE COUNCIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Participants: Students of media profile class 3D, authors of the program</strong></p>
<p><strong>Place: 4 LO in Gdańsk</strong></p>
<p><strong>Date: 9.5.2025 (2 x 45’, 10.00 – 11.40)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Objective: Formulate two recommendations to be presented at the second pilot session (21.5.2025)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prompt for ChatGPT</strong> (based on GPT-4-turbo architecture, version current as of April 2025): I kindly ask for an analysis of the answers I will present, based on the question I will also provide. The analysis should cover the following elements: pattern detection, grouping, outlier identification, aggregation of insights, sentiment analysis, and quality control. Please maintain a clear structure for the analysis and refrain from drawing conclusions beyond the scope of the provided data.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> What does a teenager need from school in order to function better in the digital world? Please provide an example. Why do you think so?</p>
<p><strong>Answers:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>In my opinion, school doesn&#39;t really have an influence on how we live in the digital world, so I don&#39;t expect anything from school in this regard.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I believe there is a need for more understanding from teachers regarding the digital world and more discussions about what is okay and what is dangerous in the digital world and how to protect oneself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In my opinion, a teenager needs a safe space for conversation from school and someone approachable who is willing to talk about cyberbullying without judging and with empathy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I think we need the school to more often raise topics about what dangers we might encounter in the digital world and how to deal with them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I think we as teenagers need classes or information about the digital world. It would show us the advantages of using the Internet, but also the drawbacks, and warn us about the negative consequences of the actions of artificial intelligence in the future.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I believe that teenagers need more space and less listening to generational comparisons. Phrases like &quot;But in my day, it wasn’t done like that&quot; and unpleasant looks. Okay, I understand, but nowadays it is like this. We need more freedom and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In my opinion, a teenager needs more comfortable space from school because it helps us feel freer when using the Internet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It would be good for a teenager to learn about safety in the digital world. They may not understand the seriousness of their actions online such as hate speech and its consequences, but also may not understand how important it is to protect their personal data online. I believe that school does not provide teenagers with such important knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In my opinion, school has no influence on our life in the digital world; perhaps more understanding from teachers could help, but I do not expect anything more from the school.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I believe that school should raise awareness of what actions in the digital world are harmful to us because some teenagers do not realize it, which can lead to unexpected consequences.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I think that to function better in the digital world, a teenager needs, above all, conversation and understanding from school. They need the comfort to talk about what is important in the digital world and beyond. For example, lessons on what to do or not to do online. Many teenagers still need to hear advice about that world.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I believe that school has no influence on how we use the Internet; I don&#39;t need anything from school. However, some basic information about online safety could be useful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>School should raise awareness — the digital world has a very large impact on the real one. Schools should teach teenagers to distinguish between these two worlds. The best way is to raise awareness and inform youth that the digital world is just an addition to life, and it should be through conversation, not by limiting access to the Internet, e.g., banning phones at school. I think it’s very necessary because I see how many people my age do not distinguish between these two worlds.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>CHATGPT answer to the prompt</strong></p>
<p>Here is a clear analysis of the answers to your question:</p>
<p><strong>1. Pattern detection</strong></p>
<p>Most frequently appearing elements:</p>
<p>·       Safe space and conversation: (answers 3, 7, 11) — need for comfort, non-judgmental conversations, emotional support.</p>
<p>·       Education about dangers in the digital world: (answers 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13) — need for information about safety, dangers, conscious use of the Internet.</p>
<p>·       Teachers&#39; attitude (understanding): (answers 2, 6, 9) — expectation of greater understanding of the digital world from adults.</p>
<p>·       Minimizing school’s impact: (answers 1, 9, 12) — belief that school has little or no impact on functioning in the digital world.</p>
<p><strong>2. Grouping answers</strong></p>
<p>Group</p>
<p>Characteristics</p>
<p>Example answers</p>
<p>Need for conversation and comfort</p>
<p>Safe space for conversations, empathy, support.</p>
<p>3, 7, 11</p>
<p>Education about the digital world</p>
<p>Information about dangers, data security, consequences of behaviors.</p>
<p>2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13</p>
<p>Criticism of teachers</p>
<p>Postulates for greater understanding, comprehension of teenagers’ digital reality.</p>
<p>2, 6, 9</p>
<p>Lack of expectations towards school</p>
<p>Belief in limited or no influence of school.</p>
<p>1, 9, 12</p>
<p>(Some answers belong to more than one group.)</p>
<p><strong>3. Outlier identification</strong></p>
<p>·       Answers 1 and 12 are outliers: they declare that school has no impact and no expectations from it, which differs from the dominant demands for support and education.</p>
<p>·       Answer 13 also stands out because it contains a more developed postulate for distinguishing between the digital and real worlds.</p>
<p><strong>4. Aggregation of insights</strong></p>
<p>·       Most teenagers expect greater awareness and digital education at school.</p>
<p>·       They place great emphasis on psychological comfort and understanding, not just on information delivery.</p>
<p>·       A small group of teenagers expresses skepticism about the school’s role in the digital world.</p>
<p><strong>5. Sentiment analysis</strong></p>
<p>Type of sentiment</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p>Example answers</p>
<p>Positive/expectant</p>
<p>Students see a possibility for support and positive change.</p>
<p>2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13</p>
<p>Neutral</p>
<p>Matter-of-fact responses without clear emotions.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Skeptical/negative</p>
<p>Belief in the lack or limited impact of school.</p>
<p>1, 9, 12</p>
<p>Dominant sentiment: Moderate optimism with a clear emphasis on the need for improvement.</p>
<p><strong>6. Quality control</strong></p>
<p>·       Consistency: The answers are logical and mostly internally consistent.</p>
<p>·       Precision: The level of detail in the answers varies (e.g., answer 13 is more developed than answer 1).</p>
<p>·       Language: The style of expression matches the teenagers’ age — informal phrases and language mistakes are visible, but the content remains understandable.</p>
<p>·       Examples: Some answers fulfill the request to provide an example, although often it is rather general than specific.  </p>
<p><strong>Further analysis of the answers by ChatGPT based on additional prompts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aspect: Explicitly expressed needs vs. hidden needs</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Most answers contain explicitly expressed needs, although often an underlying emotional need is also present: acceptance, safety, a sense of being heard.</p>
<p><strong>Aspect: Perception of the role of school</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>·       Some students see school as an active entity (educator, guide, conversation partner).</p>
<p>·       Others perceive school as ineffective or marginal.</p>
<p>·       Several answers emphasize the need for a change in school culture (understanding, moving away from judging by the past<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Aspect: Perception of oneself</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>·       About half of the answers indicate an awareness of the need for support (emotional or educational).</p>
<p>·       The other half signals independence or a desire for minimal school interference in digital life.</p>
<p>·       In several cases, there is a need for the acceptance of teenagers&#39; reality (&quot;don&#39;t compare us to your youth&quot;).</p>
<p><strong>General observation</strong></p>
<p>·       Most students do not reject school as an idea but expect more understanding, better comprehension of digital realities, and real help — both in terms of knowledge and emotions.</p>
<p>·       The perception of oneself in the digital world is ambivalent: students are aware of both the need for support and their own autonomy.</p>
<h2><a href="#Reflections"></a>Reflections</h2>
<p>One member of the Youth Resilience Council reacted on the report that she felt that she and her fellow classmates felt taken seriously. The other member stated that the report made sense.</p>
<p>While AI seems to fail at actively embracing the width and complexity of the human experience when answering a question regarding humans (see: <a href="48-Answers-both-by-humans-and-by-AI-YRC-reflection.html">blog post forty-eight</a>), it can be hypothesized that summarizing and analysing human messiness do seem appropriate tasks to be performed by AI. While implementing these tasks, its ability to simplify seems useful.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1">[1]</a> In this context, “moving away from the past” means moving away from the attitude in which teachers or adults compare today’s behavior of teenagers with “the way things used to be” and judge them negatively on that basis. Such comparisons suggest that today’s youth are “worse” than previous generations, which arouses resistance, frustration, and a sense of being misunderstood.</p>
